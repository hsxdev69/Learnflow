        answer: `### Linked Lists\n\nA **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations; instead, each element (node) stores a reference (pointer) to the subsequent node.\n\n#### Operations Complexity:\n- **Access / Search**: $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ due to mandatory sequential traversal from head.\n- **Insertion / Deletion at Head**: $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ pointer reassignment.\n- **Insertion / Deletion at Tail**: $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ with tail pointer, else $\\mathcal{O}(n)$.\n\n#### High-Yield Interview Patterns:\n1. **Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare)**: Uses slow (1 step) and fast (2 step) pointers to detect cycles in $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time and $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ space.\n2. **In-place Reversal**: Maintain three pointers (\`prev\`, \`curr\`, \`next\`) to reverse directional links without auxiliary memory.`,

It isolates computational growth rate from machine hardware specifics.\n\n#### Common Complexity Hierarchy:\n1. $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ - **Constant Time**: Direct array index access, hash map lookups, pushing to stack.\n2. $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ - **Logarithmic Time**: Binary search, balanced BST operations.\n3. $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ - **Linear Time**: Iterating through an array, linear scan.\n4. $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$ - **Linearithmic Time**: MergeSort, HeapSort, QuickSort (average).\n5. $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ - **Quadratic Time**: Nested loops, BubbleSort, SelectionSort.\n6. $\\mathcal{O}(2^n)$ - **Exponential Time**: Recursive Fibonacci without memoization, generating all subsets.\n7. $\\mathcal{O}(n!)$ - **Factorial Time**: Traveling Salesperson via brute force, generating all permutations.\n\n#### Space Complexity:\nDistinguishes between **Input Space** (data storage required for the input) and **Auxiliary Space** (temporary scratch memory or recursive call stacks created by the algorithm).`,

A thread is a lightweight execution unit sharing code, heap, and data segments with fellow threads in the same process.\n- **Deadlock Conditions (Coffman's 4 Conditions)**:\n  1. Mutual Exclusion\n  2. Hold and Wait\n  3. No Preemption\n  4. Circular Wait\n- **Virtual Memory & Paging**: Translates virtual addresses to physical RAM frames using Page Tables and Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLB). Page faults occur when referenced memory resides on swap storage.`,

Verify edge and boundary conditions (empty data sets, single items, integer overflow).\n2. Adhere to modular design patterns and clean encapsulation.\n3. Write automated unit tests verifying deterministic state invariants.\n\n*Feel free to ask for a specific code implementation in C++, Python, or Java, or request Big-O complexity analysis!*`,
